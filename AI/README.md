# AI Water Quality Monitoring

## Overview

The AI Water Quality Monitoring project explores the applications and benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of water quality monitoring. The quality of water is crucial for both the environment and human health, making effective monitoring essential. This project focuses on analyzing the status of research in this field, with a particular emphasis on neural network models.

## Abstract

The quality of water has a profound impact on the environment and human health, necessitating the critical monitoring of water quality. This research delves into the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in water quality monitoring, showcasing real-world examples and analyzing the use of neural network models, specifically Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Our findings indicate that ANN and ANFIS, despite BPNN's popularity, are likely the most useful models for predicting water quality.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the integration of AI models in water quality management has a significant social impact. Addressing concerns such as wildlife protection, biodiversity preservation, environmental sustainability, economic prosperity, and societal well-being, this project strives for a sustainable future where clean water is accessible, ecosystems thrive, and communities prosper.

Our analysis and contributions to this emerging field underscore its potential for advancements in water quality monitoring with AI. Through interdisciplinary research and the adoption of AI technologies, we aim to drive positive change and create a healthier, better future for all.
